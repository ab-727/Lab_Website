	　　This laboratory is conducting research on urban planning and traffic planning 
	in the Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Urban Management.<br>
	　　Our laboratory can be classified as a "planning systems" laboratory. 
	Students are pursuing PhDs or Master's degrees in Urban Management, 
	this lab is not for fourth year students, working in Civil Engineering or Global Engineering.<br>

	<h2>Empirical Research to Improve the Charm and Vitality of Cities</h2>
	<p>　　Cities play a variety of roles in people's lives. 
	They serve as a place of work, play, and leisure.<br>
	　　Land use causes a number of concerns, especially 
	when considering environmental, landscape and transportation issues.<br>
	　　We work towards solutions for these problems in order to increase attractiveness of 
	cities, improve longevity, and enhance the beauty of the space.<br>
	　　In addition to theoretical research, we work with real situations and examine 
	how theory can turn into practice in real cities.<br>
	　　We observe and analyze real cities in order to learn from real world situations.

	<h2>Examples of our research</h2>
	<h3>Examination of the City - Urban Structure vs. Traffic Reduction</h3>
	<p>　The study focused on how the city developed around mass transit systems available within the city.<br>
	Various structural and numerical models were created to measure this phenomenon.<br>
	If road length and traffic patterns are taken into consideration, 
	the development of commercial and residential districts will also be affected. <br>
	Urban structure will be adjusted based on the prevalence or absence of roads. </p>

	<h3>International Comparison of Rail Service Frequency and Urban Structure</h3>
	<p>　When building compact cities it is important to have adequate rail service ot provide for the people who live there. <br>
	However, it is often the case that rail service is inadequate or that trains do not stop frequently enough to be of use.<br>
	In order to understand the effects of rail access and frequency of stops we studied empirical data to measure how the population in the immediate area has changed. <br>
	In the figure below you can see population density around rail stations in Germany. <br>
	The figure shows that population increases around stations and is drawn away from areas with no rail access. </p>

	<h3>The creation of a public transportation system to revitalize a city</h3>
	<p>　Auto dependent cities are known to be more harmful to the environmental 
	and generally less convenient than cities with developed public transportation.<br>
	 However, to fully understand how the impact is reduced it is important to study the structure of the city 
	and measure how it changes when auto dependence is mitigated. <br>
	Since convenience is the key to reducing auto dependence, 
	we also study how to make railways more convenient in order to decrease the environmental impact of a city.<br>
	Southern Kyoto is a prime example of this phenomenon. <br>
	Rail lines are inconvenient for residents and as a result we can see low density, auto dependent housing sprouting up.<br>
	In cooperation with Kyoto University Urban Policy Unit for the Low Carbon Society</a>
	our lab worked on an experiment to create a door to door bus for residents.<br>
	On the left is a photo showing the low density of the housing in the area and on the right is a photo of the experimental bus.</p>
