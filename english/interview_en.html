                    <dt>—Why did you choose to study in this lab?</dt>
                    <dd>I'm interested in urban or city planning.</dd>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <dt>—What is your research topic?</dt>
                    <dd>Using Transport and Land-use Model, runs in Fortran, for simulation, I estimate population
                        distribution and traffic status iin the future. I also analyze difference in the case of
                        introduction of measures to residence attraction based on the concept of compact city. </dd>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <dt>—How do you conduct research?</dt>
                    <dd>We students need to make our own research topic, so I read some previous studies and master's
                        theses to get a whole picture of my research plan. Then I decide my research theme getting
                        feedback from professors and
                        upperclass students. For my graduation thesis, I learned simulation program coding to make my
                        own one.
                        One or two months before the submission of my thesis, I revised the program and analyzed the
                        simulation results. </dd>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <dt>—What are the challenging and enjoyable aspects of research?</dt>
                    <dd>It was challenging to think initiatively about my research plan, simulation framework,
                        interpritation of the results. On the other hand, It is enjoyable to complete my resaerch from
                        the beginning to the end, which is unique to our lab. </dd>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <dt>—How do you spend your free time?</dt>
                    <dd>I didn't have a part-time job, so I went to club activities. There are not many time
                        constraints, so I think I can spend my time rather freely.</dd>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <dt>—Can you share your comment on the student who are interested in this
                        lab?</dt>
                    <dd>Please come to our lab if you are interested in urban planning!!</dd>

                    <dt>—Why did you choose to study in this lab?</dt>
                    <dd>I was interested in urban planning for some time and the research field of this lab attracted
                        me.</dd>

                <li>
                    <dt>—What is your research topic?</dt>
                    <dd>In my master's thesis, I research about 'Compact Plus Network' that will lead to regional
                        revitalization. In concrete, I estimate the decrement of road maintenance cost as a result of
                        gathering polulation and facilities.

                    <dt>—How do you conduct research?</dt>
                    <dd>We have to decide our own research theme and frameworks by ourselves. Although research themes
                        vary from student to student, I often ask upperclass students for advice.

                    <dt>—What are the challenging and enjoyable aspects of research?</dt>
                    <dd>The most challenging moment is to decide my research theme. I also had a hard time writing my
                        graduation thesis because I had to conduct research that was meaningful to society by checking
                        existing research to determine what problems currently exist in Japan and what aspects have not
                        yet been clarified.<br>On the other hand, I enjoy being able to do research in areas that
                        interest me because I can come up with my own research themes and structure from scratch. I also
                        enjoy talking with people in the lab in my spare time.

                    <dd>I occasionally show up at clubs while doing job-hunting and part-time jobs. Since I am not bound
                        to the laboratory for much time, I feel that the environment allows me to focus on other
                        activities as long as I can manage myself.</dd>

                    <dd>Since you will be involved in the selection of a laboratory for three years (or one year) of
                        your life, I think it is important to choose not only the research content but also whether the
                        people in the lab are a good fit. That being said, since the process starts once you are
                        assigned to a laboratory, it would be good to go to a place where you genuinely feel "this
                        laboratory is good"...

                        I constructed a simulation model to follow my research theme. This may seem difficult, but there
                        is no need to worry, as we will proceed by referring to past research and receiving advice from
                        our professors and seniors in the lab. We will then run the simulation model we have built under
                        different conditions and analyze it. Sometimes the results may not be what you expected, but if
                        it is your thesis, you can write that as one of the results.</dd>

                        of urban dominant flows, mobility flow, and origin-destination trip patterns from the Mobile
                        Spatial Statistics, and then attempt to analyze the changes of the trips estimated
                        between each hour, part of day, or daily pattern.
                        In the last part of my research, I manage to be able to emphasize how the Kyoto city trip
                        pattern changes when influenced by COVID-19 situation and during Tourist season situation.

                    <dt>—How do you conduct research?</dt>
                    <dd>I will use my result as a base for my future research in understanding the anomaly of pattern on
                        the Mobile Spatial Statistics using Tensor Decomposition. Hopefully I can publish my research in
                        an international journal.

                    <dt>—What are the challenging and enjoyable aspects of research?</dt>
                    <dd>The difficult part is to find and apply methods and chose which method to apply as there will be
                        unsuitable and failed results. So it is more trial-and-error type of research. I also use
                        wasserstein distance method, which is unorthodox, therefore there are very few reference that I
                        can use, so when I am stuck, it is hard to discuss with other people as the method itself were
                        not common. <br>
                        The fun part is when we get satisfactory result that is accepting our hypotheses. For example,
                        we assume that in Kyoto city, the moving activity directed towards the center of the city
                        especially in Kyoto station and Business district of Shijo-Karasuma area. Being able to estimate
                        the trip pattern that visualize those pattern is very satisfying in my opinion. Basically, after
                        trial-and-error, finding and being able to generate proper result is always fun.</dd>

                    <dt>—How do you spend your free time?</dt>
                    <dd>I participate in part-time job to be a some kind of tour-guide for Japanese Middle/High school
                        student's study trip to Kyoto. I usually use those moment to explore Kyoto city tourist areas
                        with them (which I tend to not go if it were not because of a job), and to explore more about
                        tradition and culture in other part of Japan. It is good for practicing Japanese also. <br>
                        Other time, I use my free time to refresh my perspective (especially when I am stuck at the
                        research) by playing some console game, cycling through the river to Arashiyama, or just
                        strolling around Kyoto, taking pictures of daily city/rural perspective of the city.</dd>

                    <dd>It might be intimidating at first, but all of the student and staffs are friendly and
                        supportive. Please come~</dd>
